Hello! I'm Atalanta (they/she) and I am a first year EEB PhD student in the Rosvall
lab. I was born and raised in Washington, DC and then did my undergrad at University
of Rochester in New York. Some facts about me: I collect state and national park
quarters, I like cooking and baking, I play the violin. 

Course expectations: 
- Become more comfortable working in R
- Learn to visualize big datasets, e.g. with sequence or transcriptomic data 
- Learn to interpret kinds of figures I'm not as familiar with
